# Sample Project

This project contains a trivial 'Hello World' web server written using node.js.

Important files:

1. *package.json* - manifest file detailing 3rd party dependencies required by the application. To install the dependencies run ````npm install```` from this directory.
1. *server.js* - JavaScript file that runs the server. Execute using ````node server.js```` after following the previous step.
1. *Procfile* - this is a manifest file that instructs Heroku how to run your application (basically it contains the command specified in the previous step).
